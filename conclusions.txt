Absolutely no trend in random sparsity, either CPU or GPU, large or small matrices

Slight trend for clash free sparsity, seems like when keeping mat2 density fixed and changing mat1, sparser matrices take less time
But this trend only holds for 1 case in CPU and 1 case in GPU
It does not hold for another case in CPU
Moreover, it does not hold when keeping mat1 density fixed and changing mat2

*****
IN CONCLUSION:
Using only dense matrix multiplication routines does not lead to any computational speed gain/loss due to varying sparsity of matrices
